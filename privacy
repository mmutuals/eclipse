# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: August 28, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how eclipse ("the Bot") handles data while operating on Discord.

## 1. Data Collection
Eclipse does not collect or permanently store personal information. The Bot may process certain data in real-time (such as user IDs, command usage, and server IDs) for the purpose of delivering features and functionality.

## 2. Data Storage
Any data handled by the Bot is managed in accordance with the underlying Sapphire framework. Crave does not operate its own third-party database or external analytics.

## 3. Third Parties
Crave does not share data with third parties. However, the Bot runs on Discord’s infrastructure and is subject to Discord’s own privacy and data handling policies.

## 4. User Rights
Eclipse can remove the Bot from their server at any time.

## 5. Changes
We may update this policy as needed. Continued use of the Bot indicates acceptance of any changes.
